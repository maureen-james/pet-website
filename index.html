    <h1>MY PETS</h1>
    <p> My favourite pet is a cat. Cats are said to be the best companions and proven to reduce anxiety and stress levels, and build a loving bond between you, and cats are no exception. Many owners also find that the weight of a furry feline on their lap, and running their fingers through their fur, to be immensely calming and soothing. </p>
    <p>
        Just like human beings, cats have their favourite activities which includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Cats love and need to scratch</li>
            <li>Cats love their humans.</li>
            <li>Cats love high places for watching and hiding</li>
            <li>Cats love a clean and private bathroom space.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
