  <h3>FUNNY FACTS ABOUT CATS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>As kittens they have 26 deciduous, or “baby”, teeth. As adult cats they have 30 permanent teeth. Don’t forget to take care of those pearly whites with regular dental cleanings.
    <li>House cats share 95.6% of their genetic makeup with tigers. You read that right, TIGERS. They also share some of the same behavior habits such as scent and urine marking, prey stalking and pouncing.</li>
    <li>Cats can jump 5 times their own height. Now that’s impressive!</li>
     <li>A housecat can run to the speed of about 30 mph over short distances. This means that a cat can outrun superstar runner Usain Bolt in a 200 meter dash! </li>
     <li> Ever wondered why your feline friend would often put their rear end by your face? This is actually a sign of trust and your cat signaling that they feel safe and secure around you.</li>
      <li>Cats can have a dominant front paw. Studies have shown that male cats tend to favor their left paw while female cats may have a dominant right paw.</li>
       <li>The oldest cat to ever live was Creme Puff, who lived to be 38 years and 3 days old. Creme Puff lived from August 3, 1967 to August 2005 with her owner in Austin, Texas.</li>
       <li>The whiskers on a cat aren’t just cute, they serve a very important function in assisting cats with getting around, especially at night. Whiskers are embedded deep in the cat’s body and are connected to the cat’s sensitive muscular and nervous systems, acting as touch receptors (or a “kitty radar”). Whiskers allow a cat to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings. </li>
       <li>The wealthiest cat in the world, Blackie, had a fortune of £7 million or $12.5 million in US dollars. When Blackie’s millionaire owner passed away, the owner refused to acknowledge any human family members in his will and instead gifted his massive fortune to his last surviving cat. Now that is one lucky cat!</li>
       <li>A female cat can become pregnant as young as 4 - 6 months of age. Spaying and neutering your cat around this age is the best way to prevent any unexpected litters and help reduce cat overpopulation.</li>
